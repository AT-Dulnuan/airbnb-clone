# Airbnb Clone
Airbnb mobile app clone using React Native.
Following Vadim Savin's tutorial: [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxkmTsEYfg8&t=6769s&ab_channel=VadimSavin).

## If (I do this):
This tutorial will help me get back on my feet in mobile app development. With the design and concept already available (Airbnb app), I can focus more on the programming itself. The walkthrough also helps me when I'm stuck.

## Then:
Still at it, hold up... (tutorial not done)

## Credit Where Credit's Due
Vadim does a great job in walking his viewers through this build and he's given me an idea to be able to keep me on my toes in Development by building clones.
Highly recommend his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSa_YLoJokZAwHhlwJntIA) to React Native beginners.
