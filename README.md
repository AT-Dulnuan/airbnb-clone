# Airbnb Clone
Airbnb mobile app clone using React Native.
Following Vadim Savin's tutorial: [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxkmTsEYfg8&t=6769s&ab_channel=VadimSavin).

## If (I do this) 🤔:
This tutorial will help me get back on my feet in mobile app development. With the design and concept already available (Airbnb app), I can focus more on the programming itself. The walkthrough also helps me when I'm stuck.

## Then 💡:
I'm able to explore the React Native framework again and learn of new features (like Pressable, I didn't know that). This is just frontend so there's more space for me to try stuff out without the stress of backend (yet). It was fun. Will do more 🎉

## Credit Where Credit's Due 🙌
Vadim does a great job in walking his viewers through this build and he's given me an idea to be able to keep me on my toes in Development by building clones.
Highly recommend his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSa_YLoJokZAwHhlwJntIA) to React Native beginners.
